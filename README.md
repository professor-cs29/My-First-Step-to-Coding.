# My First Code

Welcome to my first GitHub repository!

This is the beginning of my coding journey. I'm starting with Python and using this space to upload and track my progress as I learn programming. Every file and project I upload here will represent a step forward in mastering this skill.

## What's in this Repository

- 🚀 My first uploaded file (e.g., a Python script)
- 📝 Notes and learning summaries
- 📚 Future coding projects and experiments

## Why I Created This Repo

- To practice using Git and GitHub
- To keep my code organized and backed up
- To track my growth over time

## Stay Connected

Feel free to check back for updates as I continue to learn and build.
